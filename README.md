# SmartPort

SmartPort is a physical computing prototype designed to help travellers stay on top of their boarding times. 
Built using an Arduino Pro Mini, a DS1307 real-time clock, and an OLED display, the device shows a live countdown to boarding, a real-time clock, and visual alerts for “Boarding Soon” and “Boarding Now.” 
The prototype includes three main display screens - Date, Boarding Soon, and Boarding Now - each tailored to show relevant countdown information. 
Originally conceived as a 3D-printed passport sleeve, the project evolved to prioritize accurate timing functionality through the RTC, ensuring a lightweight and achievable solution.
SmartPort demonstrates how coding, hardware, and interaction design can work together to create a small but functional travel tool that reduces stress and improves passenger awareness.
